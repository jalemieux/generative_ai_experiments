However, I can make some improvements to the code to ensure it works correctly and is more efficient.\n\nHere is the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef minimize_tokens(input_string):\n    # Split the string into tokens based on whitespace\n    tokens = input_string.split()\n    # Use a set to remove duplicates and minimize the number of tokens\n    unique_tokens = set(tokens)\n    # Join the unique tokens back into a string\n    minimized_string = ' '.join(unique_tokens)\n    return minimized_string\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"this is a test test string with some some duplicates\"\nresult = minimize_tokens(input_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExplanation of improvements:\n1. The original code was already correct in terms of functionality, but I have restructured the explanation to make it clearer.\n2. The code now includes comments to explain each step.\n3. The example usage is included to demonstrate how the function works.\n\nIf there are any specific bugs or issues you would like to address, please provide more details so I can make further improvements."
